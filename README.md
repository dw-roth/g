I can't count the times I've sat with another developer at his machine and suffered as I waited for him 
to clumsily navigate his directory structure on the command line. A conversation sometimes ensues as I drum my fingers
on his desktop:

"Why don't you have a shortcuts command file for doing this?"

"Uh, yeah, that's a good idea."

"How many minutes of your life do you think you've wasted typing 'cd ..\..'?"

...neverous, anxiety driven laughs... 

Now I have a place to point him to get him started.

Drop this in a directory that is in your path. I always make a directory named bin off %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% which I put in my path and where I drop common command line scripts.
